excerpt: 'Nepal’s climate diversity presents complex challenges for its agrarian communities, particularly in regions like Banke where agriculture is highly sensitive to climatic shifts. This study analyzed the period 1990–2020 in Janaki Rural Municipality and found a minor but steady rise in temperature (0.0946°C/year), a significant increase in sunshine hours (15.15 hours/year), and a modest rise in annual rainfall (1.94 mm/year). Statistical analysis showed that sunshine hours were significantly correlated with crop yields (r = 0.417, p = 0.017), while temperature and rainfall were not. Despite adequate overall food production, the district suffers from high dependence on monoculture, rainfed irrigation (93.3%), and limited institutional support. Year-round irrigation markedly improved productivity (7868.63 kg/ha vs. 5450.43 kg/ha). These findings underscore the urgent need for integrated, climate-resilient agricultural strategies to ensure long-term food security in Nepal’s lowland regions....'

## 🌿 Title: How Climate Change is Quietly Reshaping Agriculture in Banke, Nepal

Banke, located in Nepal's southern plains, may not often make headlines, but it represents a critical front line in the country’s battle with climate change. My recent research, conducted with colleagues over a 30-year span (1990–2020), delves into how subtle shifts in climate are impacting the region’s food systems—and what we must do about it.

### 🌡️ Climate Is Changing—Quietly But Surely
The data tells a story of slow but steady change: a minor temperature increase of about 0.0946°C per year, a significant rise in sunshine hours (15.15 hours annually), and a modest bump in yearly rainfall. At first glance, these numbers may not seem alarming. But when you're a farmer relying on rainfed fields and seasonal rainfall patterns, even small changes can make or break a harvest.

### ☀️ Sunshine Matters—More Than You Might Think
Interestingly, our study found that sunshine hours had the strongest positive impact on crop yield (r = 0.417). More sun means better photosynthesis, which translates to higher productivity. In contrast, rainfall and temperature did not show a strong or statistically significant influence on yields.

This finding has important implications: while we often worry about rainfall variability, solar radiation could be a more consistent and predictive driver of agricultural outcomes in regions like Banke.

### 🚜 Farming Practices—A System Under Stress
Despite producing enough food overall, Banke’s agricultural system is alarmingly fragile. Farmers predominantly rely on monoculture (growing the same crop repeatedly), with minimal crop diversification and limited institutional support. The vast majority of farmland—over 93%—depends solely on rainfall for irrigation.

But there’s a silver lining. Fields with year-round irrigation showed significantly higher yields—nearly 44% more than rainfed fields. This points to a clear opportunity: expanding irrigation infrastructure could be a game-changer for food security in the region.

### 🕰️ Farmers Are Adapting—but They Need Help
Farmers aren’t passive observers. They’ve begun shifting crop calendars—delaying sowing and harvesting in response to unpredictable monsoons. Yet, these grassroots adaptations need to be supported by broader institutional frameworks, including access to better technologies, subsidies for irrigation systems, and training on climate-resilient farming practices.

### 🌱 The Way Forward
If Nepal is serious about safeguarding food security and protecting rural livelihoods, it must adopt integrated climate-resilient strategies. These should include:

- 🚿 Improved irrigation systems

- 🌾 Diversified cropping patterns

- 🏛️ Stronger institutional and policy support

The sun may be shining more in Banke—but without timely action, its potential to boost agricultural prosperity may fade in the heat of climate uncertainty.

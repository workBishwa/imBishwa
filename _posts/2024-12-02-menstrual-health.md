Menstruation is a natural process and a key sign of reproductive health [^1]. The menstrual cycle in females is a naturally occurring physiological phenomenon after they reach of age. Females go through the natural phenomenon approximately **451.3 times** (median number of their lifetimes), corresponding to **34.7 years** of menstrual activity, considering an average of 13 cycles per year. The demand for effective feminine hygiene products is surging due to the increasing number of working women and changing socio-economic standards.

Sanitary napkins are absorbent materials worn in underwear to absorb blood during periods. Major categories include **panty liners, tampons, menstrual cups, and feminine wipes**.

## Composition of Sanitary Napkins

- **Fluid transfer layer**: Transfers fluid from the top cover to the secondary layer. A dry surface is essential for comfort. Modern solutions include thermoplastic fiber, which provides sufficient capillary attraction.
- **Acquisition and distributing layer**: Distributes fluid laterally and holds it for absorption. Typically made of non-woven composites.
- **Absorbent layer**: Often composed of cellulosic pulp and Superabsorbent Polymer (SAP) to enhance absorbency.
- **Barrier sheet**: A polyethylene sheet that prevents leakage.
- **Adhesive layer**: Keeps the pad in place.

### Superabsorbent Polymer (SAP)

**Sodium polyacrylate**, a common SAP, can absorb up to **300 times its weight in water**. Its safety has been extensively studied, and it is generally considered safe by the FDA. However:

- **Toxicity**: Rare skin irritation or allergies may occur.
- **Environmental Impact**: Non-biodegradable, requiring proper disposal.

#### Alternatives to Sodium Polyacrylate

- **Cotton**: Natural, absorbent, and breathable.
- **Bamboo**: Sustainable and antimicrobial.
- **Hemp**: Durable, absorbent, and eco-friendly.

## Menstrual Health Management in Nepal

In Nepal, MHM faces challenges in **waste disposal**, **sustainability**, and **socio-economic disparities**. The **median age of first menstruation** is 13.6 years. With over **10.9 million women** in the menstruating age group and approximately **290,000 menstruating daily**, Nepal produces about **900 million disposable pads annually**, of which **202 million** are exported to India.

### Disposal Practices

- Urban areas: Flushing, dustbins, or solid waste systems.
- Rural areas: Burying, burning, or discarding in pits or latrines.

The use of **cloth** increases with age and in rural regions, while **disposable pads** dominate urban usage. Government initiatives include funding free sanitary pads for **1.3 million schoolgirls**.

## Menstrual Waste Disposal Practices and Challenges

Current practices include:

- Disposing in open spaces, dustbins, or garbage.
- Burying or burning menstrual waste.
- Using incinerators or flushing soiled napkins.

### Challenges

- Non-biodegradable plastics and chemicals disrupt soil microflora and pose health risks.
- Improper handling exposes waste workers to **pathogens** and **toxic chemicals**.
- **Incineration** releases harmful gases like **dioxins**, necessitating emission controls.

### Recommended Disposal Methods (Indian MHM Guidelines 2015)

- Separate disposal bins for menstrual waste.
- Controlled incinerators or eco-friendly disposal options.

## Way Forward

1. **Eco-Friendly Product Design**
   - Transition to biodegradable and reusable products.
   - Mandate transparency in product composition.
2. **Improved Waste Management Systems**
   - Install labeled bins for menstrual waste.
   - Provide PPE for waste workers.
   - Use incinerators operating at 800°C to reduce emissions.
3. **Infrastructure Development**
   - Build women-friendly public toilets with water supply and covered bins.
4. **Education and Awareness**
   - Incorporate menstrual hygiene education in school curriculums.
5. **Policy and Legal Framework**
   - Establish guidelines for menstrual waste management.
   - Subsidize eco-friendly menstrual products.
6. **Research and Innovation**
   - Assess product sustainability.
   - Develop low-cost disposal technologies.

## Ideal Disposal Processes

### Comparison of Incineration and Composting

| Aspect                  | Incineration                         | Composting                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Process**             | High-temperature combustion         | Biological degradation              |
| **Suitable for**        | Pads without SAP, compostable pads  | Pads without SAP, compostable pads |
| **Byproducts**          | Gases, ash                          | Compost                             |
| **Implementation**      | Community or institutional          | Household or community efforts      |

### Low-Cost Incinerators

- Suitable for rural areas.
- Made from locally available materials.
- Can handle approximately **200 pads daily**.

### Electric Incinerators

- Ideal for community settings.
- Burns **150–200 pads daily**, generating minimal ash.

### Composting

- Suitable for biodegradable pads.
- Involves mixing waste with leaves and soil.

### Deep Burial

- Practical for rural areas.
- Requires pits 5–7 meters away from water sources.

## Facts and Figures

- **Total menstruating-age women in Nepal**: 10.9 million.
- **Daily menstruating women in Nepal**: 290,000.
- **Annual pad usage in Nepal**: **905 million**.

Addressing **menstrual waste disposal** is crucial for achieving environmental sustainability and ensuring the health and dignity of all women.

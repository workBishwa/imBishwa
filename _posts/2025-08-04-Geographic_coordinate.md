# Understanding Geographic Coordinate Precision and Accuracy

Geographic coordinates are crucial for navigation and mapping, but their precision and accuracy depend on decimal places and measurement tools. This blog explores how precision in degrees translates to distances on Earth's surface and the role of accuracy in different GPS technologies.

## Precision vs. Distance

The precision of latitude and longitude coordinates directly impacts the granularity of location data. Below is a table showing how decimal places in degrees correspond to distances on a spherical Earth model:

| Decimal Places | Degrees    | Distance   |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| 0              | 1          | 111 km     |
| 1              | 0.1        | 11.1 km    |
| 2              | 0.01       | 1.11 km    |
| 3              | 0.001      | 111 m      |
| 4              | 0.0001     | 11.1 m     |
| 5              | 0.00001    | 1.11 m     |
| 6              | 0.000001   | 11.1 cm    |
| 7              | 0.0000001  | 1.11 cm    |
| 8              | 0.00000001 | 1.11 mm    |

Each decimal place refines the precision by a factor of 10, reducing the distance represented. For example, six decimal places offer precision down to 11 cm, suitable for detailed tasks like surveying or tracking glacier movements.

## Accuracy and Measurement Tools

Accuracy, the closeness of a measurement to the true value, depends on the instrument used. Common GPS technologies include:

- **A-GPS (Assisted GPS)**: Used in smartphones, it offers accuracy of about 5-10 meters under good conditions, relying on cell towers and Wi-Fi for faster fixes.
- **DGPS (Differential GPS)**: Provides accuracy down to 1-3 meters by correcting GPS signals with ground-based reference stations.

Excessive precision beyond a device's accuracy can mislead users. For instance, recording coordinates to eight decimal places (1.11 mm) with a standard GPS unit (10 m accuracy) is unnecessary and may imply false precision.

## Latitude and Ellipsoidal Effects

On a spherical Earth model, one degree equals roughly 111 km. However, Earth is an ellipsoid, and longitude distances vary by latitude. The table below illustrates this for different latitudes:

| Decimal Places | Degrees    | N/S or E/W at Equator | E/W at 23°N/S | E/W at 45°N/S | E/W at 67°N/S |
|----------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0              | 1          | 111.32 km             | 102.47 km     | 78.71 km      | 43.50 km      |
| 1              | 0.1        | 11.13 km              | 10.25 km      | 7.87 km       | 4.35 km       |
| 2              | 0.01       | 1.11 km               | 1.02 km       | 787.1 m       | 435.0 m       |
| 3              | 0.001      | 111.32 m              | 102.47 m      | 78.71 m       | 43.50 m       |
| 4              | 0.0001     | 11.13 m               | 10.25 m       | 7.87 m        | 4.35 m        |
| 5              | 0.00001    | 1.11 m                | 1.02 m        | 787.1 mm      | 435.0 mm      |
| 6              | 0.000001   | 11.13 cm              | 10.25 cm      | 78.71 mm      | 43.50 mm      |
| 7              | 0.0000001  | 1.11 cm               | 10.25 mm      | 7.87 mm       | 4.35 mm       |
| 8              | 0.00000001 | 1.11 mm               | 1.02 mm       | 0.79 mm       | 0.43 mm       |

At the equator, one degree of longitude is ~111.32 km, but at 67°N/S, it shrinks to ~43.50 km due to Earth's oblate shape. This affects East-West measurements, requiring latitude-specific calculations.

## Practical Implications

- **Precision Needs**: Use decimal places aligned with your application's needs. For example, four decimal places (11.1 m) suffice for parcel mapping, while six (11.1 cm) are ideal for precise surveying.
- **Accuracy Limits**: Match precision to the accuracy of your tool. A-GPS is fine for city-level navigation (four decimal places), but DGPS is needed for centimeter-level tasks.
- **Ellipsoidal Awareness**: For high-precision tasks (cm/mm scale), use ellipsoidal models to account for latitude-dependent longitude distances.

Understanding the interplay of precision, accuracy, and Earth's shape ensures reliable geospatial data for navigation, mapping, and beyond.

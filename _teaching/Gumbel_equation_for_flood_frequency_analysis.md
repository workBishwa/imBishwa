## Equations for Gumbel Distribution

### Maximum Series
Mn = max {X1, X2, ..., Xn}

### Gumbel Equation
XT = mean + K * SD

Where:
- SD = standard deviation
- K = frequency factor  
  \( K = (YT - Yn) / Sn \)

#### Components of \( K \):
1. YT = Reduced variate, a function of T:
   YT = -[ln(ln(T / (T - 1)))]  
   Or:  
   YT = -[0.834 + 2.303 * log(log(T / (T - 1)))]  

2. Yn = Reduced mean, a function of sample size N.  
3. Sn = Reduced standard deviation, a function of sample size N.

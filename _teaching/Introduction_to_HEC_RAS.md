HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System) is a powerful modeling software developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is widely used for simulating water flow in natural and constructed channels, performing floodplain mapping, and analyzing hydraulic structures. With its capabilities to model steady and unsteady flow, sediment transport, and water quality, HEC-RAS supports comprehensive river system analysis and decision-making for flood risk management, infrastructure design, and environmental conservation.

# Personal Statement

If you ask me who are you? I cannot answer; rather, I will ask who are you asking me “WHO AM I”? Why does it matter who I am? However, it matters what I am doing. And honestly, I am trying to do fine, good, and reaching for the great.

Let’s begin the adventure towards greatness, even if it is impossible to reach the greatness. We can try, and many failures say what counts is the journey, not the destiny. Now, let’s begin that journey towards goodness, greatness, happiness, and I count this as success
